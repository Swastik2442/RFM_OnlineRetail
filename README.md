# RFM model-based Customer Segmentation using Clustering, Classification and BTYD Models

In this Project, we try to apply various Machine Learning and Statistical Models to segment and analyze Customers. Furthermore, we create Visualizations for the Data and use different techniques to improve the Models used.
